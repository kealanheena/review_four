# Review Four

This is my Fourth review at Makers.

## Challenge

Create an app that makes accademic maths tests easier to read. It should take a string and return an array with the equation and the result of the equation.

 e.g.
```
"1 + 1"

This will return:

["1 + 1", 2]
```

| input | output|
| --- | --- |
| "" | ["", 0] |
| "1 + 1" | ["1 + 1", 2] |
| "1 - 1" | ["1 - 1", 0] |
| "1 * 1" | ["1 * 1", 1] |
| "1 / 1" | ["1 / 1", 1] |

## User Stories

So I can calculate the answer,
I would like to be able to give the equation as an input.

As a User,
So I can understand how the student got their result,
I would like to see the equation in the output.

As a User,
So I can see if the student got the correct answer,
I would like to see the result in the output.
